# Documentation Method Cel-Shade: Method Vertex Color
Cel-Shade: Method Vertex Color that a way to achive cool style effect wihch u can use for roblox places project and etc and here explation how to do that.

## Introduction

This is one of my personal methods for achieving a cel-shaded look in Roblox.

The method is named after the core technique used to create this shading style. Technically, this is not a full or complex rendering system. It is a simple and practical trick that allows you to fake a cel-shaded appearance using standard tools.

### Core idea

**Cel-Shade-Method-Vertex-Color** is based on:

* Cloning the original object
* Manually modifying the mesh and vertex colors in Blender
* Adjusting Roblox lighting settings, especially using very high Sun values

The shading effect is achieved by combining modified vertex colors with lighting behavior rather than using custom shaders.

### Features and limitations

* Works on all devices, since it relies only on standard Roblox rendering techniques
* Semi-universal, can be applied to almost any object if you know how to work in Blender
* Not compatible with all player character mesh combinations
* Does not require custom shaders or engine modifications

### I'm a consumer of this project, where do I start?

Instructions for someone that may be using the production version of this project.

### Blender version

At the time this method was discovered, Blender **3.6** was used.
This version is now outdated, but newer Blender versions can also be used.
You only need to find compatible addon versions for your Blender release.

### Addons used

The following Blender addons were used during development:

* **Vertex Color Plus**

* **Vertex Color Master**
